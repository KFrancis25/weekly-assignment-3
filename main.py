# Weekly Assignment — If Statements
# Topic: Making Decisions with Code

# In this assignment, YOU will decide what decision your program makes.

# TODO 1: Ask the user a question of your choice
# Examples:
# - "What is your age?"
# - "What is your favorite number?"
# - "What is your score on the test?"
# - "How many hours did you sleep?"

question = input("Enter your question here: ")

# TODO 2: Ask the user for a value related to that question
# If you need a number, convert it using int()

value = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# TODO 3: Write at least TWO if statements that:
# - Compare the value
# - Print different messages based on the result

# Example structure:
# if value > 10:
#     print("Message for one case")

# if value <= 10:
#     print("Message for another case")

# TODO 4: Make sure your output is clear and easy to understand

print("Thank you for using my decision program!")
